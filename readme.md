This is a keyboard firmware based on the [tmk\_keyboard firmware](https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard) with some useful features for Atmel AVR and ARM controllers, and more specifically, the [OLKB product line](https://olkb.com), the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com) keyboard, and the [Clueboard product line](https://clueboard.co).

## Building Firmware

Various sizes and thumb-cluster styles are supported as keymaps. To build the firmware, use the command:
`qmk compile -kb cyboard/dactyl -km {THUMB STYLE}_{ROWS}`
where `{THUMB STYLE}` can be `manuform`, `dual_arcs`, or `single_arc`
and `{ROWS}` can be `function_row`, `number_row`, or `letters_only`

## Flashing

To flash the firmware to your Cyboard,
1. Enter the bootloader by double-tapping the reset button on the back of the board.
2. A USB device called `RPI-RP2` should appear on your computer.
3. Drag the `.uf2` firmware file into `RPI-RP2`.  `RPI-RP2` should now disappear.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 on the other half.  Your Cyboard is ready to use with your new firmware!

Personally,
1. Enter su mode
2. Run `flash` script
3. Enter bootloader
4. ???
5. Profit
